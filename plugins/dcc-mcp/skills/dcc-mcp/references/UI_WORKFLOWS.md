# Application UI workflows

### DCC UI Control fallback

Load the **DCC UI Control** runtime with `dcc-mcp-cli load-skill ui-control` only
when structured DCC capabilities cannot reach the required semantic UI:

1. `ui_control__snapshot` with an exact `process_id`, `window_handle`, or `window_title`.
2. `ui_control__find` and one semantic `ui_control__act` when possible. For native menus, use `invoke_menu` with an explicit `menu_path` when semantic delivery cannot prove a Qt popup opened; require `native_menu_path`, honor `verification_required`, and re-observe.
3. `ui_control__snapshot` after every action before choosing the next action.
4. `ui_control__stop_computer_use` when the fallback completes, fails, or is abandoned.
The runtime defaults to `dcc-cua` 0.4.0+; `mock` is test-only, never a production fallback. After loading, local `search --query "ui control snapshot"` returns the loaded `ui_control__*` slugs as callable tool hits.

The runtime consumes standalone `dcc-cua`; inspect `dcc-cua profiles` and
`dcc-cua profile --id <id>` before binding the exact PID/window. Keep
`browser_dom` inside `dcc-cua`, and use `fab/launcher_download` when UE's Fab
surface is unavailable. Cloudflare, authentication, purchase, and security
confirmations remain trusted human boundaries even with full agent access.

The UI Control `session_id` identifies its scoped UI session, not stats
attribution. Use `--agent-session-id <task-id>` for `_meta.agent_context.session_id`.

### Scoped window recovery

Use content-free native blocker facts to distinguish an independent application
window from a transient belonging to the current target. Confirm the independent
target's exact PID, full native instance and HWND; blocker metadata alone grants
no permission. With a separate owner grant, use a separately bounded,
project-owned `dcc-cua` task for that target: report provider/runtime/PID/HWND,
take a fresh snapshot, perform only the granted native minimize operation,
verify `get_window_state` reports minimized, then stop that task. Keep the
original DCC task's target and scope; do not rebind it or grant desktop-wide input.

For the original application, read fresh window state first. If it is already
restored, prefer the independently granted `activate_window` operation. If it is
minimized or maximized, restore only under the existing advertised
`frame_recovery`/`restore_window` grant. Treat `restore_activate` as one advertised
request, never an implicit retry or substitute action chain. Take fresh pixels
before further input. Use this supported recovery route before requesting manual
window rearrangement; ask the user to move windows only when the scoped route is
unavailable or actually fails. Preserve policy, desktop and interruption refusals.

### Owned pixels and secondary popup observations

An adapter owner may select an integrity-pinned `pixels_only` runtime through
`UiControlRuntimeOptions` in trusted server bootstrap. Tool arguments cannot
select that executable, transport or action ceiling. Use this mode only when
the installed Core schema and pinned native runtime support it; read the
runtime's [owned pixels contract](https://github.com/dcc-mcp/dcc-mcp-core/blob/main/python/dcc_mcp_core/skills/ui-control/references/OWNED_PIXELS_MCP.md).
Semantic `find`, `control_id` actions and `invoke_menu` are unavailable in this mode.

**Release gate:** secondary popup keyboard support is a source-stage contract
proposed in [Core #2832](https://github.com/dcc-mcp/dcc-mcp-core/pull/2832) and
[DCC-CUA #374](https://github.com/dcc-mcp/dcc-cua/pull/374). Do not use the popup
arguments below on released installations until both changes ship and their
exact compatible Core and DCC-CUA versions are recorded. The Skill suite version
alone does not satisfy this gate. Report qualification of explicitly approved,
integrity-pinned source candidates separately from released-install acceptance.

Secondary popup capture is separately disabled by default. Only the owner may
enable `allow_native_capture_popup_keyboard`; existing task authorization and
physical-input grants still apply. When enabled and advertised, select one
through eight unique exact HWNDs from the main root's fresh native capture
inventory with `ui_control__snapshot(native_capture_popup_window_handles=[...])`.
Keep the same main PID/HWND and logical session. The main PNG and its redactions
remain unchanged; each selected popup has a separately labeled real PNG and
native provenance under `native_capture_popup_overlays`. Do not composite these
images, reuse popup coordinates for input, or rebind input to a popup.

Neither those pixels nor `native_capture_popup_observation` grants input
authority. The native runtime must independently prove the exact root and
selected window instances, current foreground/focus/capture, and complete
unredacted coverage at dispatch. A valid observation supports at most one
unheld keyboard or text action to the main root within five seconds; every
attempt consumes it, including refusals. Re-observe before another attempt.
Missing support, a stale observation, or a new, foreign or unselected occluder
fails closed. Preserve that refusal and the normal stop/interruption contract.
After delivery, verify the actual application state; Enter closing a popup or
an input acknowledgement alone does not prove the requested edit.

For reusable demonstrations, start with the gateway call's `--agent-session-id`,
use structured tools first, then `stop` and `review`. After inspecting the
redacted timeline, `compile --reviewed` creates a local Skill and `WorkflowSpec`.
`replay` requires a new `--approve-replay` grant and current tool/schema. Recorded
approvals, instance/control ids, coordinates, credentials, and secrets grant no
authority. Never skip `search`, `describe`, or post-step verification.

Do not switch UI/input paths after policy, authorization, authentication,
security, confirmation, `desktop_unavailable`, or `user_interrupted` results;
the user or environment must resolve them first. Never widen scope, reuse stale
coordinates, or resume without an explicit request. Load the runtime Skill for
the complete target-binding, system-operation, capture, and artifact contract.
